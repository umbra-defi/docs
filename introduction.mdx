description: "Umbra is a privacy protocol for Solana that lets users shield token balances and transfer value anonymously - without trusting a third party with their funds."

## What is Umbra?

Umbra adds a privacy layer on top of standard Solana [SPL and Token-2022 tokens](https://spl.solana.com/token). It lets you:

- **Shield balances** - move tokens from a public SPL or Token-2022 account into an encrypted account where the balance is hidden from everyone except authorized viewers
- **Transfer anonymously** - move tokens in and out of a shared mixer pool with no on-chain linkage revealed between the entry and exit points
- **Control who sees what** - grant selective viewing access to auditors or compliance systems without exposing your full history

Everything runs on Solana mainnet using a combination of on-chain programs and [Arcium](https://arcium.com) multi-party computation (MPC) for the confidential arithmetic.

<Note>
You do **not** need to understand MPC or zero-knowledge proofs to use Umbra. The SDK handles all cryptographic operations for you.

## Core Concepts at a Glance

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Encrypted Balances" icon="shield" href="/concepts/encrypted-balances">
    Shield any SPL or Token-2022 token balance in a confidential account. Only you - and anyone you explicitly grant access to - can see the amount.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mixer / UTXOs" icon="shuffle" href="/concepts/utxos-and-mixer">
    Break the on-chain link between a deposit and a withdrawal using a shared Merkle tree and zero-knowledge proofs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="SDK" icon="code" href="/sdk/installation">
    A TypeScript SDK that wraps all protocol operations into simple async functions. Works in Node.js and browser environments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Indexer API" icon="server" href="/indexer/overview">
    A read-only REST API for querying UTXO records and Merkle proofs - used internally by the SDK and available for direct integration.

## How It Fits Into Your Stack

Umbra is designed to slot into an existing Solana application. You bring your wallet adapter; Umbra handles the rest.

```
Your App
  └── Wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
        └── Umbra SDK (@umbra-privacy/sdk)
              ├── Solana RPC    - sends and confirms transactions
              ├── Arcium MPC    - performs confidential computation off-chain
              └── Umbra Indexer - indexes UTXOs and generates Merkle proofs
```

## Program ID

The Umbra on-chain program is deployed at:

```
UMBRAkrfUTHuPAjDQXgmpoQjGGyhtqiRqWNrMroEijV
```

This address is the same on mainnet, devnet, and localnet test deployments.

## Supported Networks

- `mainnet` - Production
- `devnet` - Development and integration testing
- `localnet` - Local validator for unit tests
