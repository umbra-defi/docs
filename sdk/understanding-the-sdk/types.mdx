## Anza Solana Kit Types

The SDK is built on top of `@solana/kit` and shares its core types directly. You do not need to import `@solana/kit` yourself - these types flow through the SDK's own types naturally - but it helps to know where they come from:

- [`Address`](https://github.com/anza-xyz/solana-web3.js/blob/main/packages/addresses/src/address.ts) - a base58-encoded public key string. Every `mint`, `destinationAddress`, and `userAddress` parameter in the SDK is an `Address`.
- [`TransactionSignature`](https://github.com/anza-xyz/solana-web3.js/blob/main/packages/transaction-messages/src/transaction-message.ts) - a base58-encoded signature string. Returned by every operation that submits a transaction.
- `SignableTransaction` / `SignedTransaction` - the versioned transaction types passed to `IUmbraSigner.signTransaction`.
- `GetLatestBlockhash`, `GetEpochInfo` - RPC function types used in the `deps` of most factory functions.

If you are writing unit tests or building a custom RPC layer, the [`@solana/kit` documentation](https://github.com/anza-xyz/solana-web3.js) is the primary reference for these types.

## Function Types

Every returned function has a named type exported from `@umbra-privacy/sdk/interfaces`. Store functions in state, type React context values, or annotate variables without re-running the factory:

```typescript
import type {
  DepositIntoEncryptedBalanceFunction,
  UserRegistrationFunction,
  FetchClaimableUtxosFunction,
  ClaimSelfClaimableUtxoIntoEncryptedBalanceFunction,
} from "@umbra-privacy/sdk/interfaces";
```

This is useful when you build a factory function once and store it in React state or a context:

```typescript
const [deposit, setDeposit] = useState<DepositIntoEncryptedBalanceFunction | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (client) {
    setDeposit(() => getDirectDepositIntoEncryptedBalanceFunction({ client }));
  }
}, [client]);
```

The full list of exported function types mirrors the factory functions - one type per returned function. See the [Reference](/reference/overview) for the complete inventory.
