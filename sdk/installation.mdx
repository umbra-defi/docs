## Package

<CodeGroup>
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @umbra-privacy/sdk
```

```bash npm
npm install @umbra-privacy/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @umbra-privacy/sdk
```
</CodeGroup>

## TypeScript

The SDK is written in TypeScript and ships with full type declarations. No additional `@types` packages are needed.

Minimum TypeScript version: **5.0**.

Add the following to your `tsconfig.json` if you are targeting Node.js:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## Import Paths

The SDK exposes several sub-path imports to keep bundles lean:

- `@umbra-privacy/sdk` - All implementation modules: client, services, Solana providers, cryptography
- `@umbra-privacy/sdk/types` - Branded type definitions and type assertions only
- `@umbra-privacy/sdk/interfaces` - Function type signatures (useful for typing your own wrappers)
- `@umbra-privacy/sdk/utils` - Unit converters and encoding utilities
- `@umbra-privacy/sdk/constants` - Protocol constants (program ID, seeds, max tree depth, etc.)
- `@umbra-privacy/sdk/errors` - Error classes and type guard functions

Most applications only need the main `@umbra-privacy/sdk` import.

```typescript
// Everything you need for standard usage
import {
  getUmbraClientFromSigner,
  getUserRegistrationFunction,
  getDirectDepositIntoEncryptedBalanceFunction,
  getDirectWithdrawIntoPublicBalanceV3Function,
} from "@umbra-privacy/sdk";

// Error handling
import { isEncryptedDepositError } from "@umbra-privacy/sdk/errors";
```

## Runtime Requirements

The SDK works in both Node.js (18+) and modern browser environments. It has no native dependencies - all cryptography is pure TypeScript/WebAssembly.

<Note>
If you are using a bundler (Vite, webpack, Next.js), no special configuration is needed. The SDK uses standard ES module syntax.
