[Arcium](https://arcium.com) is the multi-party computation (MPC) network that Umbra integrates with for all operations that must remain confidential even from the on-chain program itself. See the [MPC Threat Model](https://docs.umbraprivacy.com/docs/security-cryptography/mpc-threat-model) for a full analysis of trust assumptions and attack surface.

## What MPC Handles

- **Encrypting deposits** - storing the token amount as a ciphertext on-chain rather than in plaintext
- **Authorising withdrawals** - decrypting the balance, verifying sufficiency, subtracting the amount, and re-encrypting the remainder
- **Converting MXE-only balances to Shared mode** - re-encrypting under both the network key and the user's X25519 key
- **Compliance re-encryption** - re-encrypting a Rescue ciphertext for a grantee's X25519 key under a compliance grant, without the plaintext being exposed

## Cerberus Protocol

Arcium's primary MPC backend is **Cerberus** - a dishonest majority protocol with identifiable abort.

Key properties:

- **Dishonest majority** - computation remains correct and private as long as at least one node is honest. No majority assumption is required.
- **MAC-authenticated shares** - each secret share is authenticated with a MAC. Honest nodes can detect malicious behaviour and abort the computation immediately.
- **Identifiable abort** - when a malicious node is detected, Arcium generates a cryptographic proof of misbehaviour that is submitted on-chain. The offending node is slashed automatically.
- **Offline/online phase split** - correlated randomness is generated in an offline preprocessing phase, making the online computation phase fast and communication-efficient.

This combination - dishonest majority tolerance with cryptographically identifiable and economically punished misbehaviour - provides the strongest practical security guarantees available in deployed MPC networks.

## Manticore Protocol

For computationally intensive workloads, Arcium offers **Manticore** as a secondary backend. Manticore operates under the honest-but-curious model with a trusted dealer generating offline preprocessing material before going offline. It is faster than Cerberus but carries weaker security assumptions and is intended for trusted operator environments.

Umbra's balance operations use Cerberus.

## On-Chain Integration

The Solana program interacts with Arcium via the **dual-instruction pattern**:

1. The handler instruction validates inputs, stores callback data in a PDA, and registers the computation request with Arcium
2. Arcium nodes independently compute the result and each submit a partial signature
3. Once a threshold of signatures is collected, the callback instruction is triggered automatically and the on-chain state is updated

From the SDK's perspective this is fully abstracted - every service function (deposit, withdraw, conversion, compliance) handles the two-instruction lifecycle internally.
