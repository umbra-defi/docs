openapi: "GET /v1/trees/{tree_index}/proof/{insertion_index}"
description: "Generate a Merkle inclusion proof for a specific leaf in a Merkle tree."
---

Returns an authentication path of **20 sibling hashes** -- one per level -- ordered from the leaf level (index 0) up to the root level (index 19). All hash values are little-endian 64-character hex strings (32 bytes each).

<Warning>
Merkle proofs become **stale** when new leaves are inserted into the tree (because the root changes). Always fetch a fresh proof immediately before submitting a claim. Never cache proofs across user sessions.
</Warning>

## Verifying a Proof

Hash the target leaf with each sibling in order and compare the final result to the tree's current root hash (fetch the root via [Tree Metadata](/indexer/api-reference/tree-metadata)).

## Usage in the SDK

The Umbra SDK calls this endpoint automatically via `getFetchClaimableUtxosFunction`. The proof is passed directly to the claim functions -- you do not need to call this endpoint manually when using the SDK.

If you are building a custom claim flow or integrating with the protocol directly, use this endpoint to fetch fresh proofs immediately before submitting a claim transaction.

## Performance

Proof generation traverses all 20 tree levels. Under normal conditions, proofs are generated in under 100 ms. Operations exceeding 500 ms emit a slow-operation warning server-side but still return a valid proof.
