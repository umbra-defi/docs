openapi: "GET /v1/trees/{tree_index}"
description: "Returns metadata for a specific Indexed Merkle Tree: leaf count, current root hash, and UTXO record count."
---

The root hash changes every time a new leaf is inserted. Use this endpoint to check the current state of a tree before fetching UTXOs or generating Merkle proofs.

<Note>
`utxo_count` may differ from `num_leaves` if some leaves were inserted without UTXO ciphertext data (e.g. padding leaves).
